A web application made on Streamlit to make groups of students based on the preferences, time zones, etc. 
It utilizes the k-means algorithm to form clusters in the data, automating the boring process of making balanced groups. 
Made as a project for BOLT Hackathon (September 2020). 

P.S. Very much hard coded to work on the type of form we used to collect data [sample data provided]
